      <description>Job seeking and employment situations, either full-time or internships, are hot topics for most graduate students. As new graduates, however, we may lack working experience, which will cause difficulty in understanding various situations of companies and job positions and figuring out career goals. One good way for us to know such information is to look at the reviews made by employees to their employers. In this project, we focused on a dataset of employee reviews for some top IT companies which contains information about various aspects of employers, job positions, working conditions, and other things that potential employees may concern about.</description>
