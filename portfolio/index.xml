      <description>Texas Wholesaler Distributor Database (TWDD), which is maintained by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy (TSBP), is a database that provides agency staff with information on what drug pharmacies and facilities are purchasing from wholesalers. My project improved the whole working process of TWDD by processing disorganized excel files automatically. This project gives TSBP staff the ability to manage and import wholesaler data updates with some level of automation, which saves them certain amount of time.</description>

      <description>This project tried to find a new way for personal identification based on the sensor we have on smartwatch. As today smartwarch can easily detect raw PPG(Photoplethysmography) and ECG(Electrocardiography) signal, we tried to use machine learning algorithm to see if these two signal can give us enough information for personal identification.
We cleaned raw PPG and ECG data and extracted 20 different features from filtered signals using Python. Then, we built random forest models to identify different people using selected features.</description>

      <description>Job seeking and employment situations, either full-time or internships, are hot topics for most graduate students. As new graduates, however, we may lack working experience, which will cause difficulty in understanding various situations of companies and job positions and figuring out career goals. One good way for us to know such information is to look at the reviews made by employees to their employers. In this project, we are focusing on a dataset of employee reviews for some top IT companies which contains information about various aspects of employers, job positions, working conditions, and other things that potential employees may concern about.</description>
